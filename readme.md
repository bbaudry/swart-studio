# Software art studio

In this repo I save tests and sketches for generative art pieces. Some are drafts for software art projects developed together with [re|thread](https://rethread.art/). Most of them are tests of techniques for generative visuals.

A selection of generated images is curated in [gallery](https://github.com/bbaudry/swart-studio/tree/main/gallery).
