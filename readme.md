# Software art studio

In this repo I practice generative art, visuals and sounds, in different languages.

A selection of generated images is curated in [gallery](https://github.com/bbaudry/swart-studio/tree/main/gallery) and some pieces are on [fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/almyre).

Commit messages are part of the generative art process.

[one artwork every friday](https://github.com/bbaudry/one-artwork-every-friday) is a sister repo that automatically receives one piece of generative ascii art every Friday
