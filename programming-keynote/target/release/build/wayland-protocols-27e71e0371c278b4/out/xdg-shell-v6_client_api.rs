#[doc = "child surface positioner\n\nThe xdg_positioner provides a collection of rules for the placement of a\nchild surface relative to a parent surface. Rules can be defined to ensure\nthe child surface remains within the visible area's borders, and to\nspecify how the child surface changes its position, such as sliding along\nan axis, or flipping around a rectangle. These positioner-created rules are\nconstrained by the requirement that a child surface must intersect with or\nbe at least partially adjacent to its parent surface.\n\nSee the various requests for details about possible rules.\n\nAt the time of the request, the compositor makes a copy of the rules\nspecified by the xdg_positioner. Thus, after the request is complete the\nxdg_positioner object can be destroyed or reused; further changes to the\nobject will have no effect on previous usages.\n\nFor an xdg_positioner object to be considered complete, it must have a\nnon-zero size set by set_size, and a non-zero anchor rectangle set by\nset_anchor_rect. Passing an incomplete xdg_positioner object when\npositioning a surface raises an error."]

See xdg_popup.grab for\ndetails.\n\nWhen the popup is dismissed, a popup_done event will be sent out, and at\nthe same time the surface will be unmapped. See the xdg_popup.popup_done\nevent for details.\n\nExplicitly destroying the xdg_popup object will also dismiss the popup and\nunmap the surface. Clients that want to dismiss the popup when another\nsurface of their own is clicked should dismiss the popup using the destroy\nrequest.\n\nThe parent surface must have either the xdg_toplevel or xdg_popup surface\nrole.\n\nA newly created xdg_popup will be stacked on top of all previously created\nxdg_popup surfaces associated with the same xdg_toplevel.\n\nThe parent of an xdg_popup must be mapped (see the xdg_surface\ndescription) before the xdg_popup itself.\n\nThe x and y arguments passed when creating the popup object specify\nwhere the top left of the popup should be placed, relative to the\nlocal surface coordinates of the parent surface. See\nxdg_surface.get_popup. An xdg_popup must intersect with or be at least\npartially adjacent to its parent surface.\n\nThe client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface\nfor the xdg_popup state to take effect."]

An explicit\ngrab will be dismissed when the user dismisses the popup, or when the\nclient destroys the xdg_popup. This can be done by the user clicking\noutside the surface, using the keyboard, or even locking the screen\nthrough closing the lid or a timeout.\n\nIf the compositor denies the grab, the popup will be immediately\ndismissed.\n\nThis request must be used in response to some sort of user action like a\nbutton press, key press, or touch down event. The serial number of the\nevent should be passed as 'serial'.\n\nThe parent of a grabbing popup must either be an xdg_toplevel surface or\nanother xdg_popup with an explicit grab. If the parent is another\nxdg_popup it means that the popups are nested, with this popup now being\nthe topmost popup.\n\nNested popups must be destroyed in the reverse order they were created\nin, e.g. the only popup you are allowed to destroy at all times is the\ntopmost one.\n\nWhen compositors choose to dismiss a popup, they may dismiss every\nnested grabbing popup as well. When a compositor dismisses popups, it\nwill follow the same dismissing order as required from the client.\n\nThe parent of a grabbing popup must either be another xdg_popup with an\nactive explicit grab, or an xdg_popup or xdg_toplevel, if there are no\nexplicit grabs already taken.\n\nIf the topmost grabbing popup is destroyed, the grab will be returned to\nthe parent of the popup, if that parent previously had an explicit grab.\n\nIf the parent is a grabbing popup which has already been dismissed, this\npopup will be immediately dismissed. If the parent is a popup that did\nnot take an explicit grab, an error will be raised.\n\nDuring a popup grab, the client owning the grab will receive pointer\nand touch events for all their surfaces as normal (similar to an\n\"owner-events\" grab in X11 parlance), while the top most grabbing popup\nwill always have keyboard focus."]
